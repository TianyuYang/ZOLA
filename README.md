This code have three methods, the first one is factor the given integer;
the second one is find the fibonacci number of the given number;
last one is find the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of 
the given two numbers. Also for the last method is using the first two methods,
so call the last number will give you everything in the code. 
example:
cal_cd_cm(3,6)      3,6 could be any integer you want.
output would be :
		The greatest common divisor is 3
                The least common multiple is 6
                The factors of two input numbers :
                [1,2,3,6]
                [1,3]
                The fibonacci numbers of two input numbers :
                8
                2
